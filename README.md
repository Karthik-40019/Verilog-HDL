 🚀 Verilog HDL Practice & RTL Design Repository
📌 Overview
This repository contains a structured and progressive collection of Verilog HDL programs, starting from basic logic gates and advancing toward combinational, sequential, and RTL-level digital designs.

The goal of this repository is to:
  1. Build strong RTL fundamentals
  2. Practice industry-relevant Verilog coding
  3. Prepare for VLSI / ASIC / FPGA interviews

📂 Code Organization (Learning Order)
  LEVEL 0: BASIC GATE PROGRAMS (Easiest) (1-5)
  LEVEL 1: BASIC COMBINATIONAL CIRCUITS  (6-30)
  LEVEL 2: INTERMEDIATE COMBINATIONAL
  LEVEL 3: BASIC SEQUENTIAL CIRCUITS
  LEVEL 4: INTERMEDIATE SEQUENTIAL DESIGN 

🛠 Tools Used
  1. Verilog HDL
  2. ModelSim

📈 Progress Status
✅ 30 Verilog programs completed
🔄 Continuously adding advanced RTL & system-level designs
